This project illustrates the asset pipeline issue when you have a resource named assets.

To view it working without an assets resource visit /products

To view with an assets resource and create the issue set create_bug to true.

Aptest::Application.routes.draw do
  
  create_bug = true
  
  resources :assets if create_bug

  resources :products
  
  
Then visit /products again. the image_path will fail as will the javascript and stylesheets include tags.
